        filesystem - array of quoted f.s.
        edquota - utility for working with quotas
        cat, sed, grep, getent, cut, sudo - cat, sed, grep, getent, cut, sudo - respectively
        run_sudo - True / False. True if work is required by a non-privileged user,
                for this you need to give permission to execute as root,
                as follows:% edquota ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: SETENV: / usr / sbin / edquota
  core.py - main program
  help.py - module for displaying help for the -h switch

  quota.py - quota management module
  log.log - log file
  report - report file

 Functionality -
  1) Displaying information on the user's quota.
        Command format: command --show -f filesystem -u user
                filesystem - the name of the quota file system

  2) Adding user quota.
        Command format: command --add -f filesystem -u user -s soft -h hard

  3) Changing user quota.
        Command format: command --edit -f filesystem -u user -s soft -h hard

  4) Reset user quota.
        Command format: command --remove -f filesystem -u user

  5) Obtaining a report on quotas of all users (for all f.s)
        * Additionally, the report is saved to the report file
        Command format: command --all -r

  6) Changing user quota without checking.
        Command format: command --change -f filesystem -u user -s soft -h hard

 Installation -
  1) Install packages to work with quotas, edquota must be present
  2) Register paths in cfg.py
  3) If you want to run as a user add sudo to run edquota
        set run_sudo to True
